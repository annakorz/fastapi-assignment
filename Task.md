# TASK

## Python server:
- Use FastAPI framework for the server
- Use either sqlite3 (if using sqlite as database) or any ORM (e.g. sqlalchemy) for database management
- All pip requirements with pinned versions must be placed inside requirements.txt
- * Bonus points for using asgi/wsgi interface (e.g. uvicorn) to start the server

The server must implement the following endpoints:

POST /users
example payload: {"name": "Ivan Ivanov", "email": "ivan@example.com"}
This endpoint accepts payload with user name and email (must be unique, return error otherwise), saves it in database and returns the newly created object

GET /users/{user_id}
Returns user object with the given id (this is a database id which should be generated by the database)
Please refer to this guide https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html for python best practices
* Bonus points if you get familiar with black and use it to format your code https://github.com/psf/black

## Database:
Use any relational database of your choice (e.g. sqlite)
- database must have a single table of users with the following columns: id (automatically generated), name, email (unique)
- database should be created on server startup if it doesn't exist
- database filename or connector (if using something other than sqlite) must be picked up from .env file

## Dockerfile:
Must include deployment instructions (requirements installation, startup)
Figure out how to build and run docker containers
Please refer to this guide https://testdriven.io/blog/docker-best-practices/ for docker best practices

## Repository requirements:
- requirements.txt
- Dockerfile
- .gitignore (must include .env and other unnecessary files, e.g. database, cache files, etc., you can find templates online and extend them if needed)
